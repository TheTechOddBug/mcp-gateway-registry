"""The rate limiter: orchestrates caller (Limit A) and target (Limit B) gates.

A "gate" is one (axis, entity_type, subject, window) tuple with its definition.
Every applicable gate is enforced; ALL must pass. Different ``window_seconds``
are independent gates (a burst cap and a daily cap both apply); most-restrictive
resolution applies only among a caller's groups sharing the same window.

Gates are enforced **sequentially, tightest-window-first**, stopping at the first
denial. This guarantees that a request rejected by a tight burst gate never
increments a wider volume/day gate: the burst gate is evaluated first, denies,
and the later (longer-window) gates are never touched. A concurrent design would
consume every gate's quota on every attempt, letting a rejected burst exhaust the
daily cap -- so we deliberately trade one round trip per configured gate on the
allowed path (only paid when limits are configured; bounded by the backend
timeout) for correct cross-window behavior.
